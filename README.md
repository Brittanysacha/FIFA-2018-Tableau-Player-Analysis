# FIFA 2018 Player Data and Career Trajectories

## Project/Goals
The aim of this project was to analyze the FIFA 2018 game dataset and create a dashboard that uncovers trends and patterns in leagues, countries, and players. The focus was on football player career trajectories across divisions and leagues, as well as the relationship between player's overall rating, position, and performance attributes.

## Process
### Step 1: Review Dataset
The FIFA 18 database provides information on player attributes, preferred positions, and more. It includes player details, attributes, and preferred positions.

### Step 2: Identify Missing Data Types
Important data types that were missing include country of play, league, and division level information. I manually added this information to the dataset for accurate analysis. Additional data types like revenue, net spend, last season finish, average fan attendance, and injury history could provide further insights.

### Step 3: Build Visualizations
1. Player Positions:
   - Broke down the 15 player position variables into four categories: Defenders, Midfielders, Attackers, and Goalkeepers.
   - Analyzed the distribution of players within each position across all leagues.
   
2. Highest and Lowest Wage Bills for Clubs on FIFA:
   - Explored the wage disparities among clubs in different divisions and leagues.
   - Created box plots to visualize the highest and lowest wage bills.

3. Average Player Value and Wage by Age:
   - Examined the relationship between age, player value, and wage.
   - Created scatter plots to visualize the trends.

4. Distribution of Players by Age and Impact on Rating and Potential:
   - Analyzed the distribution of players by age and its effect on player rating and potential.
   - Identified trends and patterns in player performance as they age.

5. Player Performance by Age:
   - Explored the relationship between player age, attributes, and ratings for specific positions.
   - Created visualizations to identify performance trends with age.

## Results
Based on the visualizations, some key findings were:
- Distribution of players: Majority of players are concentrated in European leagues, with variations across different countries.
- Skills and attributes: Different nationalities exhibit variations in player attributes, highlighting cultural and training differences.
- Aggregate player value: Significant disparities exist in player values across leagues and divisions, indicating varying financial resources.
- Attribute contribution to overall rating: Heat map analysis revealed the importance of specific attributes for each position.

## Challenges
- Missing data types required manual addition for accurate analysis.
- Formatting issue with map visualization was resolved using a dual axis map.
 
## Future Goals
With more time, the following improvements and research could be conducted:
- Blending data sources into a cohesive interactive dashboard.
- Analyzing correlations between position categories and attribute categories.
- Considering additional factors like revenue, net spend, and previous season finishes.
- Conducting longitudinal studies to identify trends over time.
