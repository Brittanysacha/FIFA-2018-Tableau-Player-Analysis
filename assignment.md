
In this Final Project, you can work on the dataset and formulate your own data question and Dashboards in Tableau. 
  
### Creating on Your Own Question and Dashboard
If you decide to go with Option 2, [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A02_9D5_sbLyrjnaDDiOEUvDY5qzKGJt?usp=sharing) includes the 5 datasets you can choose from. They are also all linked below. 


### FIFA2018 Player Ratings: 

This is a cleaned data set from FIFA players in FIFA 2018 with more than 17k players with 70 attributes extracted from the game. The dataset is available here as [fif18_clean.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HYMmvn4SbzOzGbrLuhUrDp742onIz4aA/view?usp=sharing).

Follow the steps below:

1. Connect your data

2. Detect different data types in your data - Which important data type is missing? 

3. Build at least 5 different visualizations to learn more about the dataset.

Player Ratings and Attributes
- What is the distribution of player ratings across different leagues and divisions? 
      - Are there any leagues on the same division level that have significantly higher or lower player ratings compared to others?

- What is the distribution of average player's wage value in Euros across each league and divisions?
      - Highlight Stats and positions for players whose cost is >= 10% of the team budget.
      - Which clubs pay the highest wages for players? Which clubs have the highest player values?

- How does a player's age correlate with their overall and potential ratings?
Which countries have the highest-rated players? Are there any countries that are overrepresented or underrepresented in the dataset?


4. This table has 70 different features. Can you detect the most important features ? Why do you think these are important? Could you define a question for yourself? Try to learn more about these categories and find appropriate numerical features to study different trends in them. 

  - For example ,  the following features could be important for your analysis :
  - Value
  - Overall
  - Acceleration
  - Balance
  - Ball Control
  - Finishing
  - KG reflexes
  - Reactions
  - Nationalities

5. In your final project presentation, you should show visualizations with:
  - Maps
  - Analytical visuals (Forecasting - Clustering)
  - Show Me tables
6. Try to find an interesting pattern, trend, outlier, etc. from the data used in the above steps.
7. From step 5, try to detect meaningful keypoints. This is the starting point to think about your dashboard. 
8. Now that you are familiar with your dataset and your columns, in this step, come up with different questions which you will be answering and presenting at the end of this project.
9. Create the dashboard to answer your questions that you came up with in step 8 and try to revise your questions along the way.
10. Get ready to present your dashboard
